Each score is meant to represent how much a car has deviated from what the typical complaint fequency is for its age and sales volume. We have compiled 20 years of historical complaint data to determine what a normal amount of complaints is for a car that's 2, 5, or even 15 years old. The score however is not meant to reflect subjective things like performance, interior design, appearance, etc. It's primarily a measure of how problematic a car has been for owners in the past.
