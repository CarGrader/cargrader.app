The Certainty percentage is meant to express our confidence in the score itself. It's primarily determined by the vehicle's reported sales figure, by calculating how easily a score is changed by a single complaint. For anyone who knows something about Statistics, sample size is essential when it comes to accuracy. Cars like a Toyota Corolla, which sell hundreds of thousands every year, have a very large sample size and the score is hardly affected by 1 or even 10 complaints and will have a high certainty percentage. But cars like an Alfa Romeo Giulia, which only sell a few thousand a year, have a small sample size and are very easily affected by a single complaint, so they get a low certainty percentage.
