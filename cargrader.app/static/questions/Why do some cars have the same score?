Every score in the database depends on the reported sales figures for that car. Some manufacturers will report sales for groups of models rather than specific trims or series. For example BMW sells the 330 and 340 models but will only report their sales as "3-Series". Chevrolet for example does not distinguish between the Silverado 1500, 2500, or 3500 in their sales reports - they are simply reported as "Silverado". While there are ways to work around these issues, we felt that the best way to maintain grading intergrity is to simply apply the same score to all the models in the group, because determining the distribution of sales within the group will ultimately require some guessing. And we simply didn't like the idea of guessing when our brand is founded on data-driven results.
