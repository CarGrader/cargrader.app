That's fine! We've tried to account for two of the biggest variables that contribute to complaint accumulation which are time and popularity.

For example there could be contributing factors like an owner's disposition to submit a complaint might vary between luxury and economy models, or owners might have been encouraged to submit a complaint due to extensive news coverage of a vehicle recall. Both of these examples, at the moment, are hard to implement into a grading algorithm and could impact the scores here. The In some rare cases the possibility of a typo does exist, and we are resolving those typos as we find them!
